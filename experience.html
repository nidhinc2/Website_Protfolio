                                <p>This summer of 2023, I interned at Yahoo as a Software Engineering Intern. I worked on an automation project for Yahoo Data Centres to reduce engineering toil, improve quality of service and save the company more than fifty thousand dollars annually by automating the verification of server health and rotation management using Agile methodologies in a multi-author python environment.

                                    As praised by my mentor, Andrew Owen, Critical Operations Engineer at Yahoo, "Nidhi was a very critical member of our team. She quickly got up to speed on the systems being used for the project and jumped right into contributing code to the project. She was able to effortlessly blend with the group and work on individual and collaborative projects, always working to improve the team. Additionally, Nidhi was able to go above and beyond the scope of her job, reaching out to other teams and contributing to other production projects after her intern project had been completed. This summer was a great success and I enjoyed being able to mentor Nidhi. I believe that any company or team would be very grateful to have Nidhi."

                                </p>

							<p>Last summer (2022), I interned at Mistral Solutions, a product design and systems engineering company headquartered in Bangalore, India in their Software Development team. I worked on porting an embedded software of a Satellite Networking terminal to a new hardware platform based on Arm A53 and FPGA running Linux kernel. I worked with code written in PHP, HTML, and Javascript in the frontend and C++ in the backend. </p>
                        </br>
                            Additionally, I interned with Nuware Technology Corporation in Summer 2021 as a data science intern. My co-intern and I built a predictive time series model from analyzing 20 years of data, which gave me an introduction to data science and how Machine Learning is used for prediction and analysis. We used SQL databases to organize our data, and PowerBI to visualize our data. These opportunities not only allowed me to apply my knowledge in a real world setting but also enabled me to gain invaluable insights into the software development industry.
